# Lawyer Firm Project Java 👨🏿‍⚖️⚖️☕

Public repository containing a Java project for a law office management system.

## Description 📄📃

The project follows the object-oriented programming paradigm (as well as 99% of Java projects),
The classes worked represent the coherent entities for existence of lawyer firm, the lawyers and the clients 
in the concrete category and court, courtroom, hearing and process in the abstract category. 
Customers can be physical type (SSN) or legal type (EIN). In order to provide better management
for the system, an entity with a level of privilege, security, and maximum access was built 
(Boss Lawyer). The interaction takes place through an initial menu that asks the user about its
type (in case they want to withdraw from the system, there is also the option), then the user is 
directed to their access privileges, with the exception of the boss lawyer. All other concrete
entities are questioned about their existence in the firm's database, when they answer in the
affirmative, they are directed to the login in which they are confronted with the request for 
their identifications, usernames and passwords.
